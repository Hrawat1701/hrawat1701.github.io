Ehhh

I guess its the first day of hard no surf? At this point, there is no social media apps on my phone, not even browser access unless i connect my phone to my laptop and enable it. Social media websites like YouTube, Reddit, Tumblr and Pinterest are blocked on my laptop's browser with a password that ive hid in the family safe. Extreme measures I know. But im tired on scrolling and scrolling and not feeling satisfied in life. Feeling like im lagging behind, unable to do the things I want to do, want to acheive. This 1st round of experiment is set till 18 Aug 2026. So 6 months. Let's see what would come out of this 6 month period. Good Luck to me.
